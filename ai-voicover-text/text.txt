Hi! I’ve created ExplainMate — a tool that helps explain content directly from the web.
The backend is written in Go, using Amazon Bedrock for AI capabilities, and the frontend is built with JavaScript. You can install it right into your browser.


Let me show you how it works with a few examples.


First, let’s try it out with some Amazon Web Services. I’m already logged into the AWS Console.

I’ll start by selecting Amazon Bedrock, right-clicking, and choosing “Explain with AI.”


Now, let’s see how ExplainMate explains EC2.


How about AWS Outposts?


And here’s Amazon Simple Notification Service, or SNS.

Now, let’s switch context and explore some of the content from my personal blog.

This article is about a dependency injection container I built in Go.

Let’s try something else.


Here’s a project where I created a multi-threaded CSV importer. I included some stats to show the massive speed improvements we can achieve using techniques like batch inserts, transactions, and parallel database connections. Let’s see how ExplainMate handles this one.


That’s it for now — thanks for watching, and see you in the next video!
